Authentication is answering the question , "is the user who they claim to be?"

1. I need users

    URLS
        GET /signup #=> see a form
        POST /users #=>actually create a user

    database
        I need a users table to store their email
2. I need to give users passwords
3. I need to makre sure that I can find a user with their actual password
4. change my login system to use their email and and password to authenticate
